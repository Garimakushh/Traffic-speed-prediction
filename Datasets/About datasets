 In this project, I have utilized two real-world traffic datasets: PEMS-BAY and METR-LA, both
 widely used in urban traffic prediction research. These datasets provide sensor-based traffic
 measurements such as speed, flow, and occupancy, along with timestamps and spatial structure,
 enabling effective spatio-temporal modeling.

📍 1. METR-LA (Los Angeles)
*Source: Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)
*Region: Los Angeles County, California
*Sensors: 207 loop detectors (traffic sensors)
*Time Span: March 1st, 2012 – June 30th, 2012
*Data Type: Traffic speed readings (in mph)
*Frequency: Every 5 minutes

#Missing Data: Contains some missing values (handled via interpolation or masking)

✅ Key Features:
*Time series of speed values
*Includes timestamps for temporal modeling
*Comes with a precomputed adjacency matrix (sensor graph based on road distances)
*Ideal for training models that learn temporal patterns and spatial relationships

📁 File Examples:
* metr-la.h5: stores the speed data

🌉 #2. PEMS-BAY (Bay Area)
Source: Caltrans PeMS

Region: San Francisco Bay Area

Sensors: 325 traffic sensors

Time Span: January 1st, 2017 – May 31st, 2017

Data Type: Traffic speed data (in mph)

Frequency: Every 5 minutes

Size: Larger and more recent than METR-LA

✅ Key Features:
More sensors than METR-LA (325 vs. 207)

Also includes a road graph (adjacency matrix)

More extensive and recent dataset

Suitable for large-scale spatial-temporal forecasting

📁 File Examples:
pems-bay.h5: contains traffic speed data
